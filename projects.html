I wanted something to help me do this, but nothing on the App Store really did exactly what I wanted as easily as I thought it could be done. That’s why I made Streaking. It’s a damn simple application that allows you to add a habit you want to form and track it over time - that’s it. Everyday it will nudge you to do your habits for the day (drink more water, floss, do 5 minutes of stretching), and you can swipe to complete them and build up a streak. That’s pretty much it. Over time the application will locally track some simple statistics about each habit to show you - how many times you do something per day, on average how often you complete the habit, etc. Development is on-going.

        <strong>This Site</strong> - made with <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com">HTMl5 Boilerplate</a> and <a href="http://materializecss.com">Materialize</a>. <em>UPDATE</em>: I originally made this site as regular site with the above components (and had a snippet about how I hate blogging...) but I've really wanted to take another stab at using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, so I created a blank blog template and migrated my website to it. It was a fun day project and now everything is a lot more maintainable when it comes to updating the content on the site as well as the design across pages due to the use of templating.<br/>

        <strong>Intro to Java Honors Project</strong> - in Java, <a href="https://github.com/grysvn/csc116-honors-project">this</a> project was to challenge myself and get honors credit for introductory computer science.  It's a GUI that allows a user to input a list of words/terms and retrieve their definition from the internet.<br />

        <img class="inlineimage" src="https://projecteuler.net/profile/grayma.png" /> <strong>Project Euler</strong> - I've been learning python through doing Project Euler problems.  It is an enjoyable yet challenging way to pass some time.  At the time I added this to the projects I had solved 44, but the image updates so that number may tick up some in the future. <em>UPDATE:</em> future Matt checking in. I have been using Project Euler for Swift moreso than Python recently. 52 problems have been solved. They're definitely not any easier.

        <a class="inlineimage" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stopwatching/id1177685578?mt=8" style="display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/assets/shared/badges/en-us/appstore-lrg.svg) no-repeat;width:135px;height:40px;background-size:contain;"></a> <strong>Stopwatching</strong> - The idea for this application came out of a combination of my desire to learn iOS development, and the lack of an existing solution that I could use to time gymnastics holds when working out.  Put simply, this app is to time activities when one cannot look at or hold a timer.  The user can enter as many (even zero) rules/activities with countdowns, breaks, and repetitions as necessary.  Once the desired activities are entered, the timer can start and notify the user when to start and stop what they're doing.  Pick it up for free on the app store!  Any reviews are greatly appreciated.

        <strong>Card Games in Python</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/grysvn/plm18_groupg">This</a> project was assigned in <a href="https://github.com/txt/plm18">Programming Languages and Modeling (PLM)</a> during the Spring '18 semester. Originally, we were told to do whatever we could to get it working. By March 3rd, 2018 (the date this project snippet was written), this is what was done. Following that, we will be implementing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific language</a> for making card games based off of the framework we started with.
