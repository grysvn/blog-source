Internet residence of Matt Gray. Clarifying for ambiguity, this Matt Gray develops software, trains for gymnastics, and is a lover of all kinds of music.

The purpose of this site is to act as a personal portal for me on the internet. I also have some things that I'd like to share my opinion on at some point including software development I find interest in, music that I enjoy listening to, and any philosophies that I may subscribe to in any field.

Whether or not I'm qualified to write about any of this is up for debate, but if you're interested in anything I put up here, please feel free to send me an email at *matt* at this domain name. I will get back to you sooner as opposed to later.
