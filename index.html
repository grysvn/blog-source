  <p>
    I'm Matt Gray, a software developer (<strong>NCSU CSC '19</strong>) that focuses on <strong>iOS application development</strong>. I'm also very interested in physical training, specifically: gymnastics strength training, powerlifting, flexibility, and handbalancing. To find a common theme, I like exploring how far one can take a discipline - mental or physical. Lastly, who doesn't love a good list, easily digestible and readable for the whole family, so here's one with some personal fun facts:
    <ul>
        <li>Software development: started in .NET and Windows land in 2009, Swift convert as of 2016.</li>
        <li>Music: indie rock/folk, emo, metal, post-rock, rap, etc.</li>
        <li>Podcasts: ATP, Reconcilable Differences, Cortex, Hello Internet, Under the Radar, etc.</li>
        <li>Miscellaneous: TV series/podcasts/books, driving, video games.</li>
    </ul>
    Below are a few excerpts from the most recent posts I've written, if you would like to view a filterable list of all posts on this site (content is spread across all of the interest areas I mentioned above), view my <a href="/posts.html">posts</a> page.
