    I write to understand my own thoughts and how to communicate them. It's pretty cathartic. You can view all posts I've written (link in sidebar) and filter by subject. Some of my favorite things I've written include <a href="/fitness/2018/05/20/an-approach-to-mobility.html">an approach to mobility training</a>, thoughts on the <a href="/thoughts/2018/09/24/on-attention.html">relationship between attention and tech</a>, and <a href="/books/2018/07/08/getting-things-done.html">my take-aways</a> from Getting Things Done. Apart from that, below is a feed of the 3 most recent things I've written:
  </p>
  <ul>
  {% for post in site.posts limit:3 %}
    <li class="post-list">
      <p>
        <a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a> • 
        {{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }} • 
        <span class="category" >{{ post.category }}</span> •
        {{ post.content | markdownify | strip_html | truncatewords: 30 }}
      </p>

  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
