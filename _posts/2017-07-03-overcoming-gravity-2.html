<span class="booktitle"><a href="http://stevenlow.org/book/">Overcoming Gravity</a></span> - As many others have said, this book is the bible of bodyweight and gymnastics strength training. From goal setting, exercise selection, routine creation, and periodization, this book provides information on how beginning, intermediate, and advanced trainees can implement these concepts. I've structured my upper-body training for the past year and a half on what I have learned (and continue to learn from the 2nd edition) from this wonderful book; I recommend it to anyone interested in athletic training. As said by the quote on the back of the 1st edition, "Lack of activity destroys the good condition of every human being, while movement and methodical physical exercise save it and preserve it." -Plato
