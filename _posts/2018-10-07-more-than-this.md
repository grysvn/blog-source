John Green's recommendation of this book isn't an overstatement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Than_This_(novel)">More Than This</a> is a fantastic fiction book that has some delightful twists throughout. I have a similar feeling towards this book as I did towards Ready Player One: it's not a forced young-adult or teenage perspective, but a realistic read inside the mind of a young character. Also, I'm a sucker for low word-per-page density and this satisfied that :).
