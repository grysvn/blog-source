Overall I don't have too much to say about [The Pearl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pearl_(novel)). I enjoyed reading it but there are better reviews and summaries out there. The situation around me reading it is something that is more special to me.

I had been talking with a good friend about how I didn't read as much as I used to before college. After talking about it for a while, I realized that it might have something to do with not reading as many books that are short, fun, or some combination of the two. She suggested The Pearl and I finished it about a month and a half ago. Since then, I have been reading off and on just about every day and I'm incredibly happy to have fallen back into step with one of my favorite hobbies.
