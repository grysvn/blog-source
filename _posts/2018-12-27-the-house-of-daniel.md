[The House of Daniel](http://turtledove.wikia.com/wiki/The_House_of_Daniel) took me a while to really *get*. It is a combination of fantasy and history that takes a deep-dive into semi-pro baseball in the 1930s, but it's filled with vampires, wizards, magic, and more of the like. I kept waiting for the magic elements to have a world-changing effect on what was happening, but they never did - and this was what I didn't understand until I had almost finished the book. The magic elements aren't supposed to have some insane gotcha as a climax to the book; the magic is just part of the universe the characters live in and they talk about it as such. 

Even though I didn't understand that, it still made the entire read refreshing to hear from a narrator in a different world talking about their existence normally. I was telling my friend that recommended this to me "I'm not sure if this is my genre, but it's something I'll return to for sure."

This is a great book especially if, like me, you grew up playing baseball. Give it a shot!
