Damn. I don't know if I have ever read such a sad book. To be completely honest, I didn't pick up the major theme of innocence preservation until after reading when I looked up opinions on the book. I just kept noticing Holden's obsession with phoniness while he kept up fake pleasantries with everyone around him (except Phoebe) while hating them for some reason or another. While that made me sad for him, it was the main thing I enjoyed while reading: going back and forth between Holden's inner monologue and how he would talk with others. That's really the main thought I felt like writing about.

What a fantastic read. From friends, I have mostly heard complaints about the lack of anything really happening in the book; I couldn't have been happier with it.
