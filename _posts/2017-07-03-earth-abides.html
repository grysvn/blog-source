<span class="booktitle"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Abides">Earth Abides</a></span> by George R. Stewart - I don't hesitate to rank <span class="booktitle">Earth Abides</span> as my all-time favorite fiction book. To not give anything away I'll keep this as short as possible. On the surface this book is incredibly different from the life that most will live (assuming we don't run into a post-apocalyptic situation in the next century), however I feel the general arc of the protagonist's story is a sad yet beautiful way to look at life. It gave me a new perspective on living and what I can accomplish with my years on Earth.
